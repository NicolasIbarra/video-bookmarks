# Video-bookmarks

This is an extension for Chrome browser. 

It lets you add different timestamps from different videos and save them in case you want to load important parts in another moment. For now it just works with YouTube videos, but my idea is to extrapolate this functionality across different video websites.

This extension is based in Chrome's Manifest V3 extension platform and it's developed in pure JavaScript. The CSS styles and assets are from https://github.com/raman-at-pieces/youtube-bookmarker-finished-code.
