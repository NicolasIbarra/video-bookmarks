# Video-bookmarks

This is an extension for Chrome browser. 

It lets you add different timestamps from different videos and save them in case you want to load important parts in another moment. This is donde by manipulating the DOM of the Chrome's YouTube tab, identifying the video screen parts like buttons and video player, and adding a "+" icon next to the YouTube controls with some functionality.

For now it just works with YouTube videos, but my idea is to extrapolate this across different video websites.

This extension is based in Chrome's Manifest V3 extension platform and it's developed in pure JavaScript. The assets and CSS styles are from https://github.com/raman-at-pieces/youtube-bookmarker-finished-code.
